# Tuning

The filters used for cancellation of the actuation signal, and frequency used for damping sensing, are dependant upon the mechanical properties of the actuator.

These properties change when objects are mounted on top of the actuator (or when the actuator itself is mounted to different objects)

This may mean that the tuning parameters need adjusting after changing the mechanical properties of the instrument.

To retune the cancellation filtering, MIDI commands can be send to the device. See the midi documentation for how to do this.
