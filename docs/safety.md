Please read the following information carefully before powering on or using the supplied hardware kit. Though the kit operates on a low voltage DC supply (5-10V, 9V when using the supplied power adapter) is it still important to adhere to basic electrical safety principles. Please keep these in mind when using the hardware kit.
# Basic Operating Procedure
- Double check any circuits before powering up the system (check for any obvious shorts or erroneously connected wires)
- Remove power from the system before making any changes to the circuitry
- Keep all elements of the hardware kit away from any liquids
- Use a 5-10V DC power supply (centre-positive) when powering the amplifier such as the provided 9V adapter. Do not use power supplies with voltages outside this range.
- Do not leave the hardware powered on while unattended
- Do not place any part of the kit on any conductive surface
- Avoid connecting headphones, or any transducer that is subsequently placed close to the ear, to the output of the amplifier to avoid sound pressure levels that exceed safe limits


# Safety Mitigations
- The amplifier IC (MAX98789) has inbuilt output short protection to prevent damage from the speaker terminals being shorted together
- The PCB has built in protection (Schottky diode) to prevent damage if a power supply with inverted polarity is plugged in
- The maximum voltage used on the board is 9V DC â€“ no high voltages are used.
- The power supply included with the kit is CE marked and a class II mains powered device (isolated).
